## 🔭 Overview

**AetherMesh** is a fully decentralized peer-to-peer synchronization framework for autonomous agent networks that modify shared codebases and metadata DAGs. It replaces locking and central coordination with a **tripartite architecture**, and is the **decentralization layer** (fourth layer) of the Aether family, above **AetherGit** (storage), **AetherFlow** (integration), and **AetherProof** (verification).

AetherMesh answers three questions together:

1. **How are concurrent changes combined** without coordination? → CRDTs
2. **How are they disseminated** without a central broker? → Epidemic gossip
3. **Which received changes may a node trust** when some peers may be faulty or hostile? → Lightweight Byzantine admission

| Release | What it adds |
|---|---|
| **v1.0.0** | Architecture specified: 4 definitions, 3 theorems, 6 assumptions, 3 pillars, with a simulated evaluation (paper) |
| **v2.0.0** | Reference implementation (`src/aethermesh/`): 107 tests, 79% coverage, 3 reproducible experiments |

## ❓ The Central Question

> **How can autonomous agents synchronize shared code and metadata without central coordination — combining concurrent changes, disseminating them, and deciding which received changes to trust — and under which explicit assumptions may the combined guarantees hold?**

This question is **structural**, not accusatory or normative. The three mechanisms (CRDTs, gossip, BFT-style filtering) are individually well known; the contribution is their specification as a single architecture for code and metadata DAGs, the explicit assumptions of the composition, and an evaluation that is clearly bounded in what it can show.

---

## 🧭 Assumptions A1–A6

*Every theorem below is conditional on these assumptions.*

| ID | Assumption | Used by |
|:-:|---|:-:|
| **A1** | **Fair-lossy channels.** A message sent infinitely often between two non-faulty nodes is delivered infinitely often. | T1 |
| **A2** | **Fair peer selection.** Each non-faulty node selects every other non-faulty node as a gossip partner infinitely often; for Theorem 2, selection is uniform and independent. | T1, T2 |
| **A3** | **Finite delta universe.** The set of deltas that will ever be created is finite, so the lattice has finite height. | T1 |
| **A4** | **Correct replicas.** Non-faulty nodes implement the join and the materialization function correctly and deterministically. | T1 |
| **A5** | **Cryptographic soundness.** Signature and hash schemes are unforgeable and collision-resistant, and the key registry is correct for the origins concerned. | T3 |
| **A6** | **Admission determinism.** Admission predicates are deterministic functions of the delta and its causal closure. | T1, T3 |

> [!NOTE]
> The supplied statement of Theorem 1 used “bounded message delay”. That is a synchrony assumption stronger than needed for eventual consistency; fair-lossy channels (A1) with continuing gossip suffice for the qualitative convergence claim.

---

## 📐 Formal Definitions

*Status: Defined, version 1.0.0.*

### Definition 1 — Convergent State Transition

```text
R_a(t+1) = R_a(t) ⊔ ⨆_{m ∈ M_a} m                                   (1)
```

Each agent `a` keeps a local replica `R_a(t)`; `M_a` is the set of incoming mutation payloads **that passed admission** during `(t, t+1)`. By commutativity, associativity, and idempotence, the order and multiplicity of payloads do not matter.

### Definition 2 — CRDT State Space

```text
(S, ⊔, ⊥)  bounded join-semilattice,   s_reconciled = s_i ⊔ s_j      (2)
```

where `⊔` is binary, commutative, associative, and idempotent.

| Property | Law | Operational consequence |
|---|---|---|
| Commutative | `sᵢ ⊔ sⱼ = sⱼ ⊔ sᵢ` | Merge order does not matter |
| Associative | `(sᵢ ⊔ sⱼ) ⊔ sₖ = sᵢ ⊔ (sⱼ ⊔ sₖ)` | Batching and grouping do not matter |
| Idempotent | `sᵢ ⊔ sᵢ = sᵢ` | Duplicate delivery is harmless |
| Inflationary (derived) | `s ⊑ s ⊔ t` | State never moves down the lattice; no rollback |

       alt="AetherMesh — CRDT Join-Semilattice (Hasse diagram)"
       width="100%">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <em>Figure 4 — A seven-element bounded join-semilattice as a Hasse diagram (⊥, s₁–s₃, s₁₂, s₂₃, ⊤). The join laws were verified on this example by exhaustive enumeration. An illustration of the algebra, not a model of a real codebase.</em>
</p>

### Definition 3 — Gossip Infection Probability

```text
P_uninfected(t) ≈ e^(−β·t)                                           (3)
```

`β` is the transmission rate constant determined by fanout `k` and exchange frequency `r`.

### Definition 4 — Byzantine Admission Rule

Before a peer accepts a remote CRDT delta `Δᵢ`, local verification daemons evaluate **cryptographic provenance**, **structural invariants**, and **semantic compatibility matrices**. Only deltas bearing valid signatures and satisfying the local predicates are admitted to the local join-semilattice.

## 📜 Theorems

> [!NOTE]
> *Status: Stated with proof sketches; **not machine-checked**; conditional on assumptions A1–A6.*

| # | Theorem | Statement | Assumptions |
|:-:|---|---|:-:|
| **T1** | Eventual Consistency | Given continuous gossip activity and channels that eventually deliver, any two non-faulty agents `aᵢ`, `aⱼ` eventually reach an identical state. Given finite height (A3), the limits are attained at a finite time. | A1–A6 |
| **T2** | Exponential Dampening of Gossip Latency | Under the constant-hazard model, `P_uninfected(t) = (1−p)^t ≈ e^(−βt)` with `β = −ln(1−p) ≈ p` for small `p`. A statement about the **tail** of the dissemination. | A2 |
| **T3** | Byzantine Fault Tolerance Bound | If `f < n/3`, local verification predicates at each honest node block all **predicate-detectable** invalid deltas with probability approaching 1. | A5, A6 |

**Theorem 3 — committee bound.** Where a decision cannot be made locally, a delta is accepted on a majority of attestations from a random committee of size `m`. Under independent sampling with Byzantine probability ≤ 1/3, the Chernoff–Hoeffding bound gives `P[Byzantine majority] ≤ exp(−0.0589·m)`:

| Committee size `m` | Upper bound on P[Byzantine majority] |
|:-:|:-:|
| 25 | 2.29e-01 |
| 50 | 5.26e-02 |
| 100 | 2.77e-03 |
| 200 | 7.67e-06 |
| 400 | 5.88e-11 |

*Values are the output of a formula under stated assumptions, not simulation results.*

</p>

<details>
<summary><b>What the proof sketches do <u>not</u> show</b></summary>

- **T1** gives no time bound; presumes `M*` is finite (or “eventually” is read relative to a fixed prefix); presumes A6, which a predicate author could violate; concerns non-faulty nodes only; says nothing about **semantic validity** of the materialized program; treats the agent set as fixed.
- **T3** does not show that invalid deltas *outside* the predicates are blocked — harmful but well-formed deltas from a signed, registered, Byzantine agent are admitted. It does not address colluding committees, Sybil identities, key compromise, or flooding.

## 🏛️ Architectural Pillars

| Pillar | Name | Summary |
|:-:|---|---|
| **1** | CRDTs for Code and Metadata DAGs | Replica state is the **set of admitted deltas** (grow-only set lifted to deltas; set union is the join). The materialized codebase is a deterministic function of the delta set (topological order with identifier tie-break). Metadata uses a product lattice (OR-sets, LWW registers, grow-only maps). **Delta-state** replication by default, state-based fallback for large divergence and joining nodes. |
| **2** | Epidemic Gossip Protocols | Five-step anti-entropy exchange (digest → digest + difference list → delta request → delta batch → local verification and join). Digest form is a parameter: version vector, Merkle tree, or Bloom-style filter. Uniform random peer selection over a partial view. Partitions heal on the first cross-partition exchange. |
| **3** | Lightweight Byzantine Fault Tolerance | Validity **filtering**, deliberately **not** a consensus protocol: (1) signature, (2) DAG integrity, (3) schema, (4) semantic compatibility matrix. Missing parents are **deferred**, not rejected. Predicates must satisfy the **admission determinism requirement** (A6). |

| Check | Evidence required | Typical failure | Verdict on failure |
|:-:|---|---|---|
| 1. Signature | Valid signature by a registered key over the content hash | Forged or unsigned delta; unknown origin | Reject |

| 3. Schema | Body parses against the delta schema | Malformed fields | Reject |
| 4. Semantics | Compatibility matrix verdict over the causal closure | Incompatible concurrent operation | Reject or quarantine, as configured |

| **Edit metadata** | ok | ok | ok | ok | resolve (LWW) |

</details>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Admission determinism requirement (our formulation).** Each admission predicate must be a pure, deterministic function of the delta and of its *causal closure* — not of arrival order, local clock, or non-causal replica contents. Local checks such as per-origin rate limits are treated as **delivery policies** that may delay a delta but never permanently reject it.

## 🧪 Simulated Evaluation (v1.0.0 paper)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section reports the **paper's** simulation (v1.0.0), distinct from the v2.0.0 experiments above. Every number is a **simulation result** from a custom Python + NumPy discrete simulation (10–500 nodes, partitioned topologies, simplified network model). **None is a measurement of a deployed system.** Simulator source, seeds, and raw traces are not included in the paper record.

### Reported results

| # | Metric | Simulation-reported result | Reading |
|:-:|---|---|---|
| 1 | State convergence latency (99% of network) | **420 ms at 250 nodes** (below 450 ms); 45–680 ms over 10–500 nodes | Reported; scaling is **not** log-linear |
| 2 | Conflict-resolution overhead | No blocking deadlocks; CPU < 5%; memory < 10% | Deadlock-freedom follows from design; overhead baseline undefined |
| 3 | Fault resilience | All injected malformed deltas blocked; 0% false positives; throughput overhead < 2% | Pipeline check for predicate-detectable faults; number injected unreported |

| Nodes | 10 | 50 | 100 | 250 | 500 |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Convergence time (ms), simulated | 45 | 120 | 210 | 420 | 680 |

### Our scaling analysis

The source material described scaling as “linear with log(n)”. Fitting the five reported points (computed by us; no other data used):

| Model | Fit | Quality |
|---|---|---|
| Linear in ln n | `T ≈ 156·ln n − 409` | R² = 0.85 (predicts −50 ms at n = 10) |
| Linear in n | `T ≈ 1.28·n + 62` | R² = 0.99 |
| **Power law** | `T ≈ 8.4·n^0.70` | **R² = 0.997 (log-log)** — best of the three |

> [!WARNING]
> **The reported values are not consistent with logarithmic scaling.** With only five points and two or three fitted parameters, the exponent is imprecise; we do not claim the true law is a power law.

| Nodes `n` | Reported (sim.), ms | Eq. (4), ms | Refined push estimate, ms | Reported / Eq. (4) |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 10 | 45 | 46 | 175 | 1.0× |
| 50 | 120 | 78 | 297 | 1.5× |
| 100 | 210 | 92 | 349 | 2.3× |
| 250 | 420 | 110 | 419 | 3.8× |
| 500 | 680 | 124 | 471 | 5.5× |

*Eq. (4): `T ≈ (ln n)/(k·r)` with illustrative `k = 5`, `r = 10 Hz`. Computed by us from the formulas; not simulation output.*

### Simulation limitations

- **Simulated data** — no real-world deployment evaluated.
- **Scale** — 10–500 nodes; behavior at thousands of nodes is unknown.
- **Simplified network model** — no real latency, packet loss, churn, NAT, or adversarial network conditions.
- **Byzantine model** — limited to malformed deltas; colluding, equivocating, withholding, flooding, and Sybil adversaries not evaluated.
- **Missing statistics** — number of runs, variance, confidence intervals, fanout, period, and baseline definition are not reported.
- **No ablation** — contribution of each pillar not isolated; no gossip-only or consensus-based comparison.

## ⚠️ Threats and Limitations

Fifteen threats (T1–T15) across six classes; residual-risk entries are the author's qualitative judgements, not measurements.

| ID | Class | Threat | Residual risk |
|:-:|---|---|---|
| T1 | Soundness | Admission nondeterminism causes divergent admitted sets | Medium |
| T2 | Soundness | Semantic-merge gap: valid deltas combine into an invalid program | High |
| T3 | Soundness | Proof sketches contain errors | Medium |
| T4 | Completeness | Well-formed but harmful deltas admitted | High |
| T5 | Completeness | False rejection from strict schema or version skew | Medium |
| T6 | Trust | Key registry bootstrap or compromise | High |
| T7 | Trust | Collusion or Sybil identities exceed n/3 | High (open membership) |
| T8 | Trust | Eclipse or peer-sampling bias | Medium to high |
| T9 | Process | Flooding, oversized digests, deferral exhaustion | Medium |
| T10 | Process | Unbounded history growth; unsafe compaction | Medium |
| T11 | Process | Costly healing after long partitions | Unknown (not simulated) |
| T12 | Toolchain | Simulator infidelity to real networks | High until evaluated |
| T13 | Toolchain | Crypto-library, serialization, or schema skew faults | Medium |
| T14 | Human | Operator misconfiguration | Medium |
| T15 | Human | Reliance on simulated results as deployed evidence | Medium |

**When *not* to use AetherMesh:** small co-located teams; strong-consistency requirements (global order, unique-name allocation, exactly-once external effects); settings where validity must hold before visibility; adversarial settings beyond the stated threat model; storage-constrained nodes (the delta set grows without compaction).

**Architectural limitations:** eventual (not strong) consistency; no global order; filters only predicate-detectable invalid deltas; assumes a trustworthy key registry; grows without compaction.

## 🔗 Relation to AetherGit, AetherFlow, and AetherProof

AetherMesh is the **fourth layer** of the Aether family:

```

| Layer | System | Question it answers | DOI | What AetherMesh requires from it |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Storage | **AetherGit** | How are changes stored and transferred? | [10.5281/zenodo.23966896](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23966896) | An append-only changeset log with parent pointers |
| Integration | **AetherFlow** | How are changes admitted, verified, and remediated? | [10.5281/zenodo.23979129](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.23979129) | A message-based protocol for submitting changes and receiving notifications |
| Verification | **AetherProof** | What conditions make behavior correct, and how are they proven? | [10.5281/zenodo.24013124](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.24013124) | Nothing mandatory; proof evidence may be carried as delta metadata |
| Decentralization | **AetherMesh** *(this work)* | How do agents synchronize state without central coordination? | [10.5281/zenodo.24038038](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.24038038) | — |

The four layers are **methodologically independent**: AetherMesh imposes only the two minimal interface requirements above. Cross-layer compositions have not been built or evaluated; the independence is a design claim, not a verified one.

| Implementation | ✅ Built (`src/aethermesh/`, 15 modules) |
| Tests | ✅ 107 passed, 79% coverage |
| Experiments | ✅ 3/3 completed (simulated data) |
| PyPI package | ✅ Published |
| Real-world deployment | None; no deployed system has been benchmarked |
| Theorems 1–3 | Stated with proof sketches; not machine-checked; conditional on A1–A6 |
| Byzantine evaluation | Limited to malformed deltas |
| Third-party claims | As reported by cited sources; not independently verified |
| Review status | Not peer reviewed |

<details>
<summary><b>Reconciliation notes (v1.0.0 departures from the supplied draft material)</b></summary>

1. **Theorem status** — labeled as sketches, not “Proven”.
2. **Delay assumption** — “bounded message delay” replaced by fair-lossy channels (A1).
3. **Admission determinism** — A6 and Section 3.3.4 added.
4. **Theorem 3** — scope clarified to predicate-detectable invalid deltas; n/3 bound placed in the quorum-based part with a Chernoff–Hoeffding bound.
5. **Latency bound** — the 110 ms estimate does not match the experimental result across sizes; text says so.
6. **Scaling claim** — “linear with log(n)” not supported by the five reported points.
7. **Deadlock elimination / 100% blocking** — largely from design and from the class of faults injected; denominators not supplied.
8. **Figures** — the five supplied figures were redrawn; Figures 6–9 are supplementary.
9. **Conclusion wording** — softened to match the evidence.
10. **References** — assembled from knowledge; verification before submission recommended.

</details>

**Catalogues:** 50 open questions (Q1–Q50) across formal analysis, state and storage, gossip and performance, Byzantine tolerance and trust, integration with other layers, and evaluation method; 52 design decisions (D1–D52). See Appendices B and C of the [paper](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.24038038).
